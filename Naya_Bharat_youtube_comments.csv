19,"It doesn‚Äôt matter whether his views are correct or not. The fact that he was brave enough to speak his mind warrants a reward in the form of these donations.
I hope others see these donations and get motivated to speak their mind as well. Freedom of speech in countries like USA is unmatchable to that in India, and this standup act is a step in that direction."

21,Thank you for being the voice of our country Kunal sir. Major major respect

36,"""You may be 38 years old, as I happen to be. And one day, some great opportunity stands before you and calls you to stand up for some great principle, some great issue, some great cause. And you refuse to do it because you are afraid‚Ä¶. You refuse to do it because you want to live longer‚Ä¶. You‚Äôre afraid that you will lose your job, or you are afraid that you will be criticized or that you will lose your popularity, or you‚Äôre afraid that somebody will stab you, or shoot at you or bomb your house; so you refuse to take the stand.

Well, you may go on and live until you are 90, but you‚Äôre just as dead at 38 as you would be at 90. And the cessation of breathing in your life is but the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit""
Thank you for being so brave!"

53,"Keep raising your voice bro. Love the courage. Our country needs this. Comedians doing the work, media is supposed to."
54,"*Echoes Unbound*  

A voice unchained, a thought set free,  
From silent depths to storming seas.  
In every word, a spark takes flight‚Äî  
A beacon in the thick of night.  

No shackled tongue, no muted cry,  
The poet‚Äôs verse, the rebel‚Äôs sigh.  
They carve their truths in open air,  
Defying chains, defying fear.  

But shadows loom where power creeps,  
To hush the hum where conscience speaks.  
Yet still the pulse of voices swells‚Äî  
A chorus born from broken wells.  

So let the ink and breath collide,  
In every heart, let truth reside.  
For freedom‚Äôs song, though scarred, survives‚Äî  
A flame that dances, never dies."

In these difficult times‚Äîwhen the downtrodden and oppressed seem abandoned by justice, and the world just seems to move on‚Äîit is incredibly inspiring to see you live with unwavering conscience, honesty, morality, and a steadfast commitment to truth, even as corrupt forces prevail. As one of my friends once said, when you are powerless, the smallest act of defiance is to keep your conscience alive and pass it on to future generations, nurturing the hope of ultimate freedom. Thank you, Kunal, for leading by example and reminding us that even in the darkest times, the light of truth can never be extinguished."

Not to forget the documentary you made, ‚ÄúThe Free Market‚Äù it was truly commendable. People who think your content is just for sensationalism should definitely watch it to see the effort and thought that have been put into it. 
Take care "

Please know that you‚Äôre not alone. Each one of us may be facing different battles but at the core we‚Äôre in the same boat, driven by the same desire for truth, justice, and a better tomorrow. Let‚Äôs stay connected, stay united, and keep pushing forward together.

Sending you strength, love, and all my best wishes, always.

So this is the India we live in , in our own mother land we are treated as outsiders and everyday is like a struggle. I don't hate any religion but the increasing hate towards us makes me despise them . They taunts us as we claim we are peaceful community, Man do you have doubt about that , just look at the internet, you will see news of oppression toward us everywhere.  Even they passed a Waqf bill to take our land and properties.  I just hope someday they dont take  away the land of my Qabar . I truly believe I come from the Two India ."

740,"Kunal bhai posting this with a hope that maybe you and other youtubers can revolutionize something. This is about the recent incident where MNS Workers are beating Bank and Dmart employees and asking them to Speak in Marathi and threatening them on Open TV while there is no law as such


I've heard that Late Shri Balasaheb Thackeray used to say, ‚ÄúJai HIND, Jai Maharashtra‚Äù, clearly signifying that the nation comes first. But today, some goons have hijacked this sentiment. Hindi is our national language, yet we're being attacked for speaking in our National language itself? It's 2025, Fu*kg 2025, are we seriously still fighting over languages within our own country?


Is there any law mandating that we must speak only Marathi? Who gave these people the right to beat others for not using a specific language? If they feel Marathi should be officially mandated, let them go through the legal route instead of imposing their own laws through violence.


Where is the law and order in this country? We're dividing ourselves from within, while ignoring the real issues ‚Äî Manipur crisis, unemployment, inflation, poverty, corruption, pollution, crime, assaults on tourists, and rising rape cases. Bloody yeh sab Desh ke Core Serious Issues hain ispe koi baat hi nahi kar raha? Sabka Prime Time Attention kispe hai? A comedian‚Äôs joke. Studios get vandalized, threats are given on live TV, and even the CM comments on such trivial matters, but stays silent on national crises.


Yes, we‚Äôre the 4th largest economy, yes, there's digitalization and improved infrastructure ‚Äî and I appreciate that. But what‚Äôs the point if citizens don‚Äôt even feel safe? If the democracy is being Torn apart? If thugs can beat you in public for speaking Hindi ‚Äî the national language ‚Äî and no one does anything, what kind of progress is that?


This internal decay is far more dangerous than any external threat. And now some Andhbhakts will say, ‚ÄúGo to another country if you don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt was worse during Congress rule,‚Äù or even ‚ÄúLook at Pakistan.‚Äù That‚Äôs not the point. Just because others are doing worse doesn‚Äôt mean we should suffer like this.


Today, we are crumbling from within. The core issues of our nation are being ignored while goondaism rises and democracy weakens. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to watch a country we love, a country once known for peace, culture, and humanity is falling apart like this "

826,"I agree with nearly everything that Kamra says. Literally everything. But I don't understand why he insists that we should worship muslims as if they are a boon from the gods.
Hinduism is a regressive religion. No doubt about it. But islam is even more regressive. If hindus have oppressed women....muslims have oppressed women many times over. I still don't understand why we are being told to worship muslims. If India mistreats 'religious minorities', islamic countries mistreat religious minorities 10 times worse. There is literally nothing to emulate from islamic countries, except that the BJP/RSS are emulating islamic countries in their functioning, to the T.

I have a colleague who is a Pakistani Christian (obviously, I don't live in India), who tells me of the horrors that religious minorities have to face in Pakistan...from christian women having acid thrown on their faces for wearing skirts, to churches being burnt, to people being lynched for alleged 'blasphemy' of islam.
Sorry Kamra, but there is absolutely no rhyme nor reason to worship muslims or islam."

But a funded speech screams out loud it‚Äôs funded isn‚Äôt funny anymore. He doesn‚Äôt need YouTube advertisers. He is paid more than any of your generations can ever earn. So feel miserable about the country and live in a delusion that you‚Äôre a defiant and that makes you cool. Because he has already earned his funded speeches while you kept feeling miserable about the country and the petty lives. Why don‚Äôt they crack jokes on congress or other communities ever ? Oh wait ! In that case they will be killed not jailed. It‚Äôs not about freedom of speech, it‚Äôs about freedom of choosing alliances and in the garb of comedy constantly hammering things to change narratives while dimwits think they‚Äôre doing some revolutionary thing for the country."
